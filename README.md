# BlogPoint
As my first project in Web Development, I decided upon a very simple blogging application. This has been buit using React for frontend, Express for backend and MongoDB for storing data. The main highlight of this application is the editing section which is light version of the editing interface found in Medium. The application is deployed on Heroku with the database hosted on MongoDB Atlas.

You can visit the live application here: [BlogPoint](https://blog-website-myidispg.herokuapp.com/)

## Main Features
* Read and write blogs
* Add paragraphs, subheadings and images to the blogs as necessary
* Lazy loading on the home page
* Beautiful design inspired by [Dwinawan on Pinterest](https://dribbble.com/shots/15238065-Blog-Personal-Website)

## Editing Features
Each blog posts can have 3 types of contents:
* Paragraphs
* Sub Headings
* Images

The user is presented with a very intuitive design for editing a blog post. By default, a user is presented with an option to write paragraphs. There are relevant icons to allow the user to convert a paragraph section to heading sections or image sections. For a demo, visit the link to the website and start writing a blog!
